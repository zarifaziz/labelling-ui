They correctly target the skill 'Representing decimals on the number line': the easy question asks the student to identify the decimal value of a given mark, the medium question requires comparing distances of two decimal marks from an endpoint, and the hard question asks for the midpoint between two decimal marks, all of which involve locating and interpreting decimals on a number line. The dinosaur context (paleontologist, fossils, dinosaur egg lengths) is naturally integrated and adds engagement without feeling forced or irrelevant. Mathematical difficulty progresses logically from a direct recall (easy) to a two‑step subtraction/comparison (medium) and to a two‑step calculation of a midpoint (hard), matching the target success rates for each level. No advanced terminology beyond the required skill is used, and no extraneous concepts are introduced.

The skill alignment is spot‑on: the easy item tests set notation by asking for a list of routes; the medium item tests understanding of what a sample space represents by requiring a count of outcomes from two binary choices; the hard item requires representing a sample space with a tree diagram and then listing it in set notation, directly matching the third skill. The mountaineering context is genuine – each scenario reflects realistic decisions a climber might make (choosing a ridge, trail & weather, rope length & helmet type) and is not merely decorative. Difficulty progression is suitable: the easy question is a direct single‑step task that all Year 7 students should solve; the medium question adds a simple counting step appropriate for ~90% success; the hard question involves constructing a tree diagram, listing ordered pairs and counting them, a multi‑step task that aligns with an ~80% success target. No forced context or extraneous concepts are introduced, and the missing ""questionReasoning"" fields are irrelevant as they were intentionally omitted.

However, the hard question is mathematically incorrect. The problem ""_47 + 295 = 722"" has no integer digit that satisfies the equation; solving 100d + 47 + 295 = 722 gives d = 3.8, which is not a valid digit. The supplied answer ""4"" does not make the sum true (447 + 295 = 742, not 722). Because the critical math content is wrong, the hard item fails to assess the intended skill and cannot serve as a valid exit‑ticket question.

However, the medium and hard questions break several core criteria. Both use numbers far above the Prep range (37‑58 and 63‑95), violating the age‑appropriate number limit of 0‑20. Their sentences are long, contain multiple clauses, and exceed the eight‑word maximum for Prep language. The tasks also require ordering three two‑digit numbers and reasoning about the middle value on a 0‑100 number line, which is beyond what Prep students are expected to master. Moreover, the context of ""scores"" in a table‑tennis game is unrealistic for a child at this level (table‑tennis games go to 11 points), making the context appear forced rather than genuinely supportive of the mathematics. Because the medium and hard items do not meet the language, number range, difficulty, and context authenticity standards for Prep, the overall set fails the evaluation.",FAIL,,,,

The guidelines require each sentence to be very short (≤8 words) and contain no clauses.

In the hard question the first sentence ""A tiger exhibit has $8$ circles in one corner and $7$ circles in another corner."" contains 15 words, also exceeding the limit and using a conjunction. While the easy question obeys the word limit, the other two violate it, breaking the critical age‑appropriate language rule. Additionally, the hard question has a grammatical error (“How many circles is in the whole exhibit?”) which further reduces clarity. The context of tigers is loosely attached but not clearly necessary for counting circles, making it feel somewhat forced. Because the primary criterion—age‑appropriate language—is not satisfied, the overall output fails the evaluation.",FAIL,,,,

The language is formal and concise, each question fits within a single sentence, and the terminology (altitude, runway length, nautical miles) is suitable for this grade level. The pilot context is realistic and directly motivates the need for unit conversion, so the context is not forced. All three items test the exact skill of converting between units of length without introducing unrelated concepts. The provided answers are mathematically correct using standard conversion factors. The difficulty ordering is reasonable: the easy question requires a single division, the medium question requires recalling a conversion factor and performing a multiplication with a non‑round result, and the hard question involves two sequential conversions, matching the multi‑step requirement for a harder item. A minor shortcoming is that the medium question does not state how to handle the decimal result (whether to round), which could lead to slight ambiguity, but this does not undermine the overall alignment with the skill or the grade‑appropriate expectations.

Each problem asks the student to divide a polynomial by a linear divisor and to state the quotient, directly testing the skill “Solving polynomial long division problems with a linear divisor and zero remainder”. The algebraic work is correct and the quotients match the supplied answers. 

Difficulty progression is sensible: the easy item (quadratic ÷ linear) is a single‑step division that virtually all Year 10 pupils can solve; the medium item (cubic ÷ linear) requires one additional step of polynomial long division; the hard item introduces a non‑monic divisor (3x+6) which increases procedural complexity without adding new concepts, matching the target 80 % success rate. 

The context “UFOs” is not referenced in the questions. According to the guidelines, context should only be included when it genuinely enhances understanding and forced or superficial connections must be avoided. Because a UFO scenario would not add mathematical value here, omitting it does not constitute a forced context and therefore does not breach the authenticity rule.

They use formal mathematical language, include the correct terminology, and each question directly tests the skill of finding equations of horizontal or vertical lines. The context of a chessboard is genuine: ranks correspond to horizontal lines and files to vertical lines, and a rook’s movement naturally reinforces these concepts, so the context is not forced. The difficulty progression is sensible: the easy question only requires recognizing that two squares share the same rank, yielding y = 4; the medium question similarly requires recognizing a shared file, yielding x = 2; the hard question requires writing two equations for a rook’s two‑segment move, a modest increase in steps appropriate for a hard level. All questions are concise, within the allowed sentence count, and do not introduce new concepts. The only minor issue is that students must translate chess notation (e.g., e4 → (5, 4)) which adds a tiny conversion step, but this is inherent to the context and does not undermine the skill assessment.

- **Skill alignment**: The skill list includes ""Naming numbers up to twenty"" which is not directly assessed; the medium question tests writing a numeral from a word, not naming the number.  The easy question tests naming numbers up to ten, and the hard question tests Roman numerals, but the ""up to twenty"" skill is omitted.  
- **Context authenticity**: While camels are a plausible desert theme, the Roman numeral on a saddle strap feels contrived and does not add genuine mathematical value.  The context feels inserted mainly to satisfy the prompt rather than to enhance understanding.
