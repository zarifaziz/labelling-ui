It directly practices the target skill – calculating the discounted amount – by having students use the formula discount = price × rate and then compute the final price, which is mathematically accurate and appropriate for Grade 9 percentages. The steps are listed in a clear, sequential order, and the final step (“Teams compare prices to determine the best deals”) introduces a collaborative, game‑like element that engages students and provides a natural transition. Discussion questions ask students to reflect on strategies and real‑world budgeting, promoting mathematical reasoning beyond rote calculation. Differentiation is meaningful: the support option supplies concrete examples for struggling learners, while the extension adds tax calculations, deepening the problem‑solving context. Language, concepts, and the use of percentages match Grade 9 expectations, and the scenario of planning a store sale is a realistic, authentic context for discount calculations. Overall the activity meets all critical criteria, so it receives a PASS.",PASS,,,,

It aligns directly with the skill of converting all parts of a ratio to the same unit; students must convert miles to kilometers (or vice‑versa) before forming ratios, and the conversion factor given is correct. The steps are numbered, sequential, and include a collaborative component (as a team). While the name suggests a race, the procedure does not spell out a competitive scoring system, but the group work and discussion give a game‑like feel. Instructions are clear overall, though step 3 could be more explicit about which ratios to write. The discussion questions probe reasoning about unit consistency, and the differentiation offers concrete support and an extension that adds a time‑calculation layer, providing deeper mathematical thinking. Language and concepts are appropriate for Grade 7, and the travel‑distance context is realistic and motivates the mathematics. Overall the activity meets the required standards.",PASS,,,,

However, it is not fully self‑contained: it assumes the teacher will supply “given coordinates” and “stated rules” without listing them, and it does not provide an explicit materials list (graph paper, pencils, ruler). This hidden preparation violates the critical self‑contained design criterion. In addition, the activity lacks any explicit collaborative structure, which is required for the engagement criterion. Because a critical criterion is unmet, the activity fails the evaluation.",FAIL,,,,

No pre‑printed worksheets or specialised manipulatives are required, satisfying the self‑contained design criterion. It directly targets the skill “Applying BODMAS to number problems with exponents” – students must create BODMAS‑type expressions that include exponents and then solve their peers’ expressions, ensuring genuine practice of the rule. The example provided (3^2 + 2) and the extension (nested brackets with exponents) are mathematically correct and appropriate for Year 9, confirming accurate skill alignment. The steps are presented in a clear, sequential list, and although they are not explicitly numbered, the bullet format conveys order unambiguously. The activity is collaborative (teams), competitive (points, 2‑minute time limit), and includes a race element, meeting the engagement and clarity requirements. Discussion questions probe understanding of exponent priority and problem‑solving strategies, while the differentiation section offers concrete support and a deeper extension, providing meaningful scaffolding and enrichment. Language is formal and suitable for Grade 9, and the scenario of a classroom “puzzle race” is realistic and naturally motivates the mathematics, satisfying grade‑level appropriateness and context authenticity. Overall, the activity fulfills all critical and high‑priority criteria, so it receives a PASS.",PASS,,,,
